# Taming ArchiCAD's floating  palettes with Slate Window Manager.

Hi!

I ended up here looking for a solution in order to keep ArchiCAD's floating palettes under control prior to AC19.  In the Windows version the user is allowed to dock them, that's not the case with the one for Mac OSX and experienced a hard time after been forced to use an Apple Computer.

The following lines are an exctract from the part focused on this issue wich I called project [m] just to give it a name.
