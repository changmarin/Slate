Taming ArchiCAD's floating  palettes.

Hi!

I ended here looking for a solution in order to keep ArchiCAD's floating palettes under control.  In the Windows version the user is allowed to dock them, that's not the case with the one for Mac OSX and experienced a hard time after been forced to use an Apple Computer.
